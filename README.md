# Text Preprocessing Example

This notebook demonstrates basic text preprocessing using NLTK in Python. It tokenizes, cleans, and removes stop words from a sample text.

## Functionality

1. **Tokenization:** Splits text into words using `nltk.word_tokenize`.
2. **Cleaning:** Removes punctuation and converts to lowercase.
3. **Stop Word Removal:** Eliminates common words using `nltk.corpus.stopwords`.

## Usage

1. Install NLTK: `!pip install nltk==3.8.1`
2. Download resources:
3. 3. Run the code cells in sequence.

## Input Data

The code uses a sample sentence: 
"This is a simple example: we're going to preprocess this text, removing stopwords and punctuation."

## Output

The code prints:

* Original Text
* Tokenized Text
* Cleaned Text (after removing punctuation and stopwords)

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* NLTK library

## Notes

* This is a basic example and can be extended for more complex preprocessing tasks.
* Consider exploring NLTK's other features for stemming, lemmatization, etc.
